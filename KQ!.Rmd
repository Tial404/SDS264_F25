## National Park Data

`park_data` is a 54x3 tibble containing information scraped from national park webpages for a past SDS264 final project.  A few notes about the 3 columns:

- `park_code` is a 4-letter code used as a key when merging files

- `address` is comprised of 4 pieces (described from *right* to *left*): the street address (followed by at least 2 space), the city, a 2-letter state abbreviation (followed by a comma), and the zip code (which could be 5 digits or 5 digits, a dash, and 4 more digits)

- `activities` is a string of activities offered at each park, where activities are separated by commas

Here's a small preview of `park_data`:

```{r}
print(park_data[c(2,3,4,29,36),])
```



## Quiz Questions

Please answer the following questions using your knowledge of strings and regular expressions.  Use `stringr` functions wherever possible.


1. Find the subset of all `address` entries that contain a direction (north, south, east, or west) that may or may not be capitalized.

Hint: `str_subset(park_data$activities, "FILL THIS IN!")`

2. Create a new tibble containing only national parks in Alaska (AK) and Hawaii (HI).

3. The following code creates a new tibble with the `address` column and then the 4 new columns below, which break apart `address` into its 4 pieces: `street_address`, `city`, `state`, and `zip_code`.

**For 3 of the 4 pieces,** explain what each line is doing, and how it produces the desired outcome.  (Hint: str_trim() simply trims off any spaces at the beginning or end of a string)

```{r}
four_pieces <- park_data |>
  mutate(
    street_address = str_trim(str_extract(address, "^.*( ){2,}")),
    city = str_trim(str_extract(address, "( ){2,}.*[A-Z]{2}")),
    city = str_replace(city, " [A-Z]{2}", ""),
    state = str_extract(address, "[A-Z]{2},"),
    state = str_replace(state, ",", ""),
    zip_code = str_extract(address, "[\\d-]+$")
  ) |>
  select(address, street_address, city, state, zip_code)
```

\pagebreak

```{r}
print(four_pieces, n = 5)
```


Use your new tibble from (3) to answer Questions (4) and (5).  

4. Print the subset of `street_address` entries where the numerical part is 1000 or greater.

5. Arrange `city` names from longest to shortest.

Use the `activities` column from `park_data` to answer Questions (6) - (8).  An example of the first entry in that column is give below:

```{r}
cat(str_wrap(park_data$activities[1], width = 80))
```

6. Create a new column in `park_data` which records the total number of activities in each park.  Hint:  since activities are separated by commas, the total number of activities can be thought of as "# commas + 1".

\vspace{2cm}


7. Find the subset of entries from the `activities` column that have a capital letter / lower case letter combination that repeats later in the phrase (e.g. "Gh" appears twice).

\vspace{2cm}


8. Find the subset of entries from the `activities` column that have the same consonant appear twice in a row.
